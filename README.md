Research on social network analysis of publications in Scielo from authors linked to Unicamp and UFRJ. 

**Code and data**

Code were done with Python. Data was obtained from Scielo database in July 2019, based on publications categorized as “Business & Economics”.

**Main packages used**

Besides the regular packages used in cleaning, manipulating and visualizing data, the package graph-tool was used to create graphs of the network between authors.

**Main findings**

The database had more publications from UFRJ, which resulted in a more dense network. From both networks, it was possible to see some usual groups of authors that publish together. Both networks are illustrated below, which each node represents an author and linked nodes means coauthors in a paper. Further, the amount of publications of each author is represented by more dark green the node is.
